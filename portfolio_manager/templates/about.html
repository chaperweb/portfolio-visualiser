      <h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>
					This software aims to be a tool for collaborative, open and agile portfolio and other project related data management. The idea is to build a tool which allows opening the	information to every member of the organization and possibly also to the customers. The tool helps in creating common understanding and in making decisions by visualizing the data in multiple ways.
